# Invoice Factoring

Request Network supports Invoice Factoring, thanks to the RequestNFT.

The workflow is the following:

* Create a request
* Request is approved for payment
* Mint a RequestNFT
* Sell the RequestNFT for a fee (to a Lender or an NFT Marketplace)
* When the request is paid, the money is sent to the owner of the RequestNFT

This effectively allows you to receive money in advance for a future invoice.
